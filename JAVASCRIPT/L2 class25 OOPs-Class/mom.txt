Last class --> SetInterval, SetTimer

ES6 Todays class --> Class, class constructor

Classes and OOPS

---------------------------------------------

Class

Objests - Class ->> C++, Java, -->> object se Class banti ha 

But 

In JavaScrpit 

Class - Objects - ES5 - Function constructor

ES6 - Class Keyword introducted 

Class -->> BluePrint, Logical Thing, Skeleton

Example like --> {
    
    Human Class
    Animal class
}

Classes also have property. Example like -->{

    Human class - 2 hands, 2 legs, eating foods, Breathing, behaviour.

    Animal class - dog - 4 legs, eating food, Breathing, loyal.
}

Syntax

class class-anme{

    property and behaviour


    default constructor

    // property and value set
}

------------------------------------

OOPs - OOPs stands for Object-Oriented Programming. It's a programming paradigm that uses objects as its fundamental building blocks.

OOPs 4 PILLARS - The four pillars of OOPS (object-oriented programming) are Inheritance, Polymorphism, Encapsulation and Data Abstraction.

1. Encapsulation. -->  The process of wrapping properties and functions within a single unit is known as encapsulation.

2. Polymorphism. --> Polymorphism is one of the core concepts of object-oriented programming languages where poly means many and morphism means transforming one form into another. Polymorphism means the same function with different signatures is called many times. In real life, for example, a boy at the same time may be a student, a class monitor, etc. So a boy can perform different operations at the same time. This is called polymorphism.

3. Inheritance.

4. Data Abstraction.

// JavaScrpit have main 2 - Encapsulation and Inheritance.

1. Encapsulation --> Wrapping up of Data into a single unit - Class. // 

2. Inheritance -->  Extends


//--------TYPES OF INHERITANCE-------------


// 1.   Single Inheritance.
// 2.   Multiple Inheritance.
// 3.   Multilevel Inheritance.
// 4.   Hierarchical Inheritance.
// 5.   Hybrid Inheritance.
