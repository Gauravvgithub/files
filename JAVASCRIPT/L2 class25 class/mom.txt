Last class --> SetInterval, SetTimer

ES6 Todays class --> Class, class constructor

Classes and OOPS

---------------------------------------------

Class

Objests - Class ->> C++, Java, -->> object se Class banti ha 

But 

In JavaScrpit 

Class - Objects - ES5 - Function constructor

ES6 - Class Keyword introducted 

Class -->> BluePrint, Logical Thing, Skeleton

Example like --> {
    
    Human Class
    Animal class
}

Classes also have property. Example like -->{

    Human class - 2 hands, 2 legs, eating foods, Breathing, behaviour.

    Animal class - dog - 4 legs, eating food, Breathing, loyal.
}

Syntax

class class-anme{

    property and behaviour


    default constructor

    // property and value set
}

------------------------------------

OOPS - OOP stands for Object-Oriented Programming. It's a programming paradigm that uses objects as its fundamental building blocks.

OOPS 4 PILLARS - The four pillars of OOPS (object-oriented programming) are Inheritance, Polymorphism, Encapsulation and Data Abstraction.

1. Encapsulation.

2. Polymorphism.

3. Inheritance.

4. Data Abstraction.

// JavaScrpit have main 2 - Encapsulation and Inheritance.

1. Encapsulation --> Wrapping up of Data into a single unit - Class.

2. Inheritance -->  Extends


//--------TYPES OF INHERITANCE-------------


// 1.   Single Inheritance.
// 2.   Multiple Inheritance.
// 3.   Multilevel Inheritance.
// 4.   Hierarchical Inheritance.
// 5.   Hybrid Inheritance.
