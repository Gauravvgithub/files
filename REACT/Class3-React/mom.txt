In Detail

Case 1. Parent to Child (C1 → C2): Use props to pass data.

Case 2. Child to Parent (C2 → C1): Pass a callback function from parent to child, and the child calls it to  send data to the parent.

Case 3. Child to Children (C2 → C3): Parent acts as a mediator by holding the shared data in its state and passing it down to the children as needed.
